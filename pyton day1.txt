A single python file is calledas module

Interactive mode is basically gave respose line by line

Scripted mode is typical way to perfome code where a python file is created and the code is executed all at once

Indentation is most important block of code

OPERATORS:
1. special operators are also known as membership operator
2. floor division returns an integer value
3. exponent **
   / gives quotient
   % gives remainder
4. assigenment operators are used to assign values to variables
5. comparison operators are performed based on the values
6. || pipe operator
7. we don't have to use sign in program instead have to use words like and, not, or
8. bitwise operators are
  1. a | b : perform OR operation en each bit of the no.
  2. a & b : perform AND operation on each bit of the no.
  3. a ^ b : perform XOR operation
9. ^ known as caret
10. Identity operators are:
    1. is: true if the operands are identical(refer to the same object)
    2. is not: true if the operands are not identical(do not refer to the same object)
11. it checks the address and not the values
12. Membership operators are the operators which are used to check whether a value/ variables exists in the sequence like string. tuples, set, dictionary or not
13. Membership operators are:
    1. in
    2. not in
